Description:
This is a sandbox mission file designed for just about anything imaginable. You play as NATO with access to both a Pyrgos and Molos Air Field or CSAT utilising the AAC Airfield or the Centeral Altis Military Outpost; all from which you can spawn jsut about any utilities in ARMA III accessible, all at your pleasure. Enjoy - Panorpha

To Do:
- Merge misc folder with teleport folder as it is no longer being utilized for 2 functions
- move pan_fnc_pmenu_init to a different file location as it is not just for the teleport function, but for the initialisation of all of the player menu.
- clean up resources folder
- Safezone:
	- Create a safezone from scratch. Refrence Moldi's prior safezones from other missions for a push in the right direction.
- Convert pictures to .paa
- Merge all of the playerMenu GUIs into one. Consult Moldi on the best approach to do so.

In Game Hotkeys:
	- Earplugs F1
	- Player Menu: F2
	- Jump: Left Shift + V
